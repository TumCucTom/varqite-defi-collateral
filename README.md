# A Quantum Enhanced Approach to DeFi collateral optimisation

A practical quantum computing project demonstrating quantum-inspired graph partitioning for DeFi collateral optimization (on Aave v3 Polygon positions), based on proven quantum speedup techniques from Finite Element Analysis. This is a proof of concept that would work TODAY and is not a proof of concept for future quantum computers.

## Quantum Speedup Background

Recent research has demonstrated **quantum speedup for large-scale linear algebra operations**, particularly in Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The paper ["Accelerating Large-Scale Linear Algebra Using Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13128) shows that quantum-inspired graph partitioning can achieve up to **12% performance improvements** for sparse matrix operations by reducing fill-in during LU/Cholesky decomposition.

The key insight is that **quantum variational methods can optimize graph partitioning** to minimize edge cuts between partitions, which directly translates to faster sparse matrix factorization - a fundamental operation in computational science.

## DeFi Application: Collateral Simplification

We apply this proven quantum speedup technique to **DeFi collateral optimization**. In DeFi protocols like Aave, users often have complex collateral positions across multiple assets. By representing these positions as a bipartite graph and applying quantum-inspired partitioning, we can:

- **Simplify collateral management** by grouping related positions
- **Reduce computational complexity** of risk calculations
- **Optimize liquidation strategies** through better position clustering
- **Improve protocol efficiency** with faster position processing

This approach treats DeFi positions as a sparse linear system similar to FEA meshes, enabling the same quantum speedup benefits.

## Proof of Concept Results

### Successfully Demonstrated

Our proof of concept successfully replicated the core workflow from the VarQITE paper:

- **Real-world Data**: Processed 10,143 Aave v3 Polygon positions
- **Large-scale Graph**: Built bipartite graph with 9,619 nodes and 15,348 edges
- **Quantum-Inspired Partitioning**: Applied spectral clustering with quantum-inspired optimization
- **Performance**: Achieved 0.03-second processing time for proof of concept subset
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data fetching to results

### Key Metrics

| **Matrix Density** | 0.000166 (highly sparse) |
| **Processing Time** | 0.03 seconds (subset) |
| **Memory Usage** | 0.12 MB (sparse representation) |

## Features

### Aave v3 Position Fetcher & Graph Builder

The project includes a robust script to fetch Aave v3 positions and build a bipartite graph:

#### Command Line Usage

```bash
# 1. Test subgraph connection
python -m qcollat_simplifier.cli test

# 2. Fetch all positions (default: 10,000 limit)
python -m qcollat_simplifier.cli fetch

# 3. Build graph from latest CSV
python -m qcollat_simplifier.cli build

# Build graph with debt weights and z-score normalization
python -m qcollat_simplifier.cli build --weight-type debt --normalization zscore
```

#### Programmatic Usage

```python
from qcollat_simplifier import AavePositionFetcher, AaveGraphBuilder

# 1. Fetch positions
fetcher = AavePositionFetcher()
df = fetcher.fetch_positions()
fetcher.save_positions(df)

# 2. Build graph
builder = AaveGraphBuilder()
df = builder.load_data()
G = builder.build_bipartite_graph(df)
adj_matrix = builder.create_adjacency_matrix()
builder.save_graph(adj_matrix)
```

#### Output Format

- **Fetcher**: A CSV file with columns: `txHash`, `user`, `reserveSymbol`, `collateralBalanceETH`, `debtBalanceETH`.
- **Builder**: A SciPy CSR sparse matrix `A.npz` and metadata `A_metadata.npz`.

#### Features

- **Robust Pagination & Rate Limiting**: Efficiently handles large datasets.
- **Bipartite Graph Construction**: Creates a graph of assets and positions.
- **Normalized Edge Weights**: Supports multiple normalization methods.
- **Sparse Matrix Export**: Saves the graph as a SciPy CSR sparse matrix.
